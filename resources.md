## Plant aminotransferase (AT) database:

Various AT genes were synthesized through **JGI Community Science Program (CSP award 503757)**. If you are interested in obtaining some of these clones, please contact **Hiroshi Maeda, University of Wisconsin-Madison** at <maeda2@wisc.edu>.


### *Arabidopsis thaliana ATs*
The total of **[81 AT candidates from Arabidopsis thaliana](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sKc8emlIbMW3ehuNgex_3LA8BpyT154dQF55s4V_nPI/edit?usp=sharing)** were synthesized into **the pEU vector** for in vitro translation. 

As a comparison, **[19 E. coli AT genes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wDYjcP5n5RaZ2fp7FwJbHMckW0Wz0lE3beT60OJ3p68/edit?usp=sharing)** were also synthesized into the pEU vector.



### *Sorghum bicolor ATs*
The total of **[98 AT candidates from Sorghum bicolor](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ffAFImUYVaM3WVJst4MjU-BYWgHGzyzYVgPTWByW5C0/edit#gid=0)** were gene synthesized and cloned into **the pEU vector** for in vitro translation as well as **a modified pET28 vector (pETm3SmRS)** for E. coli expression and Level0 vector for the Golden Gate cloning.
