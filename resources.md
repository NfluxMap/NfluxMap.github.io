## Plant aminotransferase database:


### *Arabidopsis thaliana*
The total of 81 AT candidates from Arabidopsis thaliana were gene synthesized by JGI (through CSP award 503757), cloned into the pEU vector for in vitro translation. As a comparison, 19 E. coli AT genes were also synthesized into the pEU vector.

### *Sorghum bicolor*
The total of 98 AT candidates from Sorghum bicolor were gene synthesized by JGI (through CSP award 503757), cloned into the pEU vector for in vitro translation as well as a modified pET28 vector (pETm3SmRS) for E. coli expression and Level0 vector for the Golden Gate cloning.
